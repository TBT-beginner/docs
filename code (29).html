        <h1>Reference Material 1.</h1>
        <p class="source-agency">Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) - JAPAN</p>

        <h2>Reference Examples Concerning Disciplinary Action, Corporal Punishment, etc., for Children and Students as Stipulated in Article 11 of the School Education Act</h2>

        <p>This document provides concrete examples to serve as a reference for schools regarding how specific cases might typically be judged. It is intended purely as a reference, presenting and organizing examples concisely. When determining whether an individual case constitutes corporal punishment, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the various conditions outlined in Notification 2(1) and judge each case individually.</p>

        <h3>(1) Corporal Punishment (Actions Generally Considered Corporal Punishment)</h3>

        <h4>&#9675; Actions involving physical infringement:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Stepping on the back of a student who performed a dangerous act during physical education class.</li>
            <li>Pushing over a student who was dangling their feet and kicked the student in front of them during the end-of-day meeting, causing them to fall.</li>
            <li>Slapping the faces of multiple students who showed rebellious behavior after being reprimanded for their attitude in class.</li>
            <li>Pinching the cheek of a student who frequently walks around during class and wouldn't sit down despite being told, to make them sit.</li>
            <li>Slapping the head of a student who, defying guidance, tried to leave school, after the student pulled their arm away when grabbed.</li>
            <li>Throwing a ballpoint pen at a student who was misbehaving during lunch and didn't listen to verbal warnings, hitting the student.</li>
            <li>Punching the cheek of a student who disobeyed the club advisor's instructions and didn't properly put away their uniform.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>&#9675; Actions causing physical pain to the disciplined person:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Making a student remain in the classroom after school and refusing to let them go to the toilet despite their request.</li>
            <li>Keeping a student in a separate room for an extended period, including during lunchtime, for separate guidance, and refusing to let them leave the room at all.</li>
            <li>Telling a student who forgot their homework to receive lessons while sitting formally (seiza) at the back of the classroom, and forcing them to maintain that posture even after the student complained of pain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>(2) Permissible Disciplinary Actions (Actions generally considered within the scope of disciplinary authority, provided they do not involve physical pain)</h3>
        <p><em>※ Examples other than expulsion, suspension, and reprimands stipulated in the Enforcement Regulations of the School Education Act:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Making a student remain in the classroom after school, etc.</li>
            <li>Making a student stand in the classroom during class.</li>
            <li>Assigning learning tasks or cleaning duties.</li>
            <li>Assigning more school duties (e.g., class monitor).</li>
            <li>Making a student who frequently walks around sit down after scolding them.</li>
            <li>Making a student who was late for practice sit out and observe the game instead of participating.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>(3) Justifiable Acts (Actions generally considered justifiable, such as self-defense or justifiable acts)</h3>

        <h4>&#9675; Use of tangible force necessarily employed for defense against violent acts by children/students towards teachers, etc.:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When a student resists a teacher's guidance and kicks the teacher's leg, the teacher goes behind the student and holds their body firmly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>&#9675; Use of tangible force necessarily employed to stop violent acts that inflict harm on other children/students, or to avoid imminent danger:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Pulling apart a student by grabbing both shoulders, when they were holding down and hitting another student in the hallway during break time.</li>
            <li>Guiding a student who was disrupting an all-school assembly by shouting loudly to move to a different location for guidance. When the student continued to shout and resist, pulling their arm to move them.</li>
            <li>When attempting to guide a student who was teasing other students, the student hurled verbal abuse and spat at the teacher and tried to run away. Holding the student's shoulders with both hands against a wall for several minutes until they calmed down, thereby restraining them.</li>
            <li>Restraining a student who got into trouble with an opponent player during a match and was about to strike them.</li>
        </ul>
