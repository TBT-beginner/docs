    <h1>Issues in Student Guidance</h1>
    <h2>Corporal Punishment, Inappropriate Guidance, and Harassment</h2>
    <div class="footer">
      April 15, 2025<br>
      Owada & Yatabe Law Office<br>
      Attorney: Wataru Yatabe
    </div>

    <h2>1. About Corporal Punishment</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Prohibition of Corporal Punishment</h3>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>School Education Act, Article 11:</strong><br>
      "Principals and teachers may discipline students as deemed necessary for educational purposes, as prescribed by the Minister of Education. However, corporal punishment is strictly prohibited."
    </div>

    <h3>1.2 Difference Between Corporal Punishment and Disciplinary Action</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Corporal Punishment:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Acts that physically harm students</li>
          <li>Actions that cause physical pain</li>
          <li>See Ministry of Education's reference cases for specific examples</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Acceptable Disciplinary Actions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Expulsion, suspension, warnings</li>
          <li>Reprimands, detentions, separate instruction, standing, homework, cleaning duties, classroom chores, written guidance, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Acts Not Considered Corporal Punishment (Justifiable Defense):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Reasonable physical intervention to defend oneself from student violence</li>
          <li>Reasonable physical intervention to prevent harm to other students or to avoid imminent danger</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Why Corporal Punishment Is Unacceptable</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>It is an illegal act that violates students' human rights and can result in criminal and civil liability.</li>
      <li>It can cause serious physical and mental harm to students and erode trust in teachers and schools. In severe cases, it can even lead to student suicide, as seen in the Sakuramiya High School case.</li>
      <li>Corporal punishment does not foster proper moral values and may instead perpetuate cycles of bullying and violence, especially in club activities.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1.4 Current Situation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Overall, cases are decreasing.</li>
      <li>Incidence is higher in high schools.</li>
      <li>Most cases involve teachers aged 50 and above.</li>
      <li>Most incidents occur during classes or club activities (club activities are the most common in high schools).</li>
      <li>Private schools have a higher incidence and often impose severe penalties such as dismissal or suspension.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.5 Legal Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Criminal Liability:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Assault (up to 2 years imprisonment or a fine up to 300,000 yen)</li>
          <li>Bodily injury (up to 15 years imprisonment or a fine up to 500,000 yen)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="case">
          <strong>Case Example:</strong> In the Sakuramiya High School suicide case, the teacher was sentenced to 1 year in prison (suspended for 3 years) for assault and bodily injury.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Civil Liability:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Liability for damages (compensation for medical expenses, emotional distress, etc.)</li>
          <li>The school corporation (employer) is also liable.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="case">
          <strong>Case Example:</strong> In the Sakuramiya case, the Tokyo District Court ordered Osaka City to pay about 75 million yen (about 87 million yen including interest) to the bereaved family. The city later sued the former teacher for half of the compensation, and the Osaka District Court ordered full payment.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Disciplinary Actions:</strong> Dismissal, suspension, pay cuts, warnings, etc. (as stipulated in private school regulations)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Other Consequences:</strong> Criticism from parents, media and online exposure, loss of teaching qualifications
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.6 Preventing Corporal Punishment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Anger management</li>
      <li>Developing guidance skills that do not rely on corporal punishment</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Inappropriate Guidance and Harassment</h2>
    <h3>2.1 What Is Inappropriate Guidance?</h3>
    <p>
      In recent years, even verbal abuse that does not constitute corporal punishment has led to tragic cases such as student suicides. The revised Student Guidance Manual (Dec. 2022) highlights the importance of avoiding inappropriate guidance.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>From the Student Guidance Manual (p. 105):</strong><br>
      "Even if there is no physical harm or pain, repeated excessive reprimands or unnecessary warnings can increase students' stress and anxiety, undermine their confidence and motivation, and push them into a corner. What may seem like routine guidance to teachers can be perceived differently by each student. Excessive reprimands, even if directed at the whole class, can be felt as pressure. After giving guidance, it is important not to leave students alone and to observe their physical and mental state. Inappropriate guidance can trigger truancy or suicide, so any form of corporal punishment or inappropriate behavior is never acceptable in any aspect of school life, including club activities."
    </div>

    <h3>2.2 Examples of Inappropriate Guidance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Shouting, hitting objects, or throwing things in an intimidating or emotional manner</li>
      <li>Guiding students based on assumptions without listening to their side or confirming facts</li>
      <li>Acting unilaterally without considering organizational responses</li>
      <li>Reprimanding students in front of others, damaging their dignity or privacy</li>
      <li>Guiding students in places that cause significant anxiety or pressure</li>
      <li>Imposing collective responsibility, causing undue burden or guilt</li>
      <li>Failing to provide appropriate follow-up, such as leaving students alone after guidance or not contacting parents</li>
      <li>Persistently blaming students for things they cannot do, without offering proper advice or support</li>
      <li>Deliberately withholding necessary information for club activities or events</li>
      <li>Showing favoritism or bias in guidance or grading</li>
      <li>Reprimanding students in a way that denies their character or self-worth</li>
      <li>Imposing personal values or beliefs without considering students' feelings</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. Sexual Harassment, Power Harassment, and Other Forms of Harassment</h2>
